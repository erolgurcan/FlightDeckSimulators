            Flight Sim Deck works by connecting to your flight simulator software and
            collecting data in real-time. You can then view this data in
            customizable charts and graphs, allowing you to identify patterns and
            trends that may be affecting your performance. FlightViz also allows you
            to analyze historical data, which can be particularly useful for
            identifying areas where you may need to improve your skills or adjust
            your approach.
